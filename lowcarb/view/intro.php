      <h3>About this blog</h3>
      <aside>Everything you need to know</aside>
      <p>This blog is Tom Ashworth's CM1102 Web Applications coursework.
      <p>Inspired by the <a href=//codeigniter.com>CodeIgniter</a> framework, I built a blog-focused object-oriented MVC framework. The intention is that each module of the framework is interchangeable, and that there is a 'one size fits all' mentality for models.
      <p>It uses a tiny (read <em>limited</em>) version of John Gruber's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, named Minidown, built because I couldn't use someone else's library.
